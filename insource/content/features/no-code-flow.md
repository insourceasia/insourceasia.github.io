Langflow is an easy way to prototype [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) flows. The drag-and-drop feature allows quick and effortless experimentation, while the built-in chat interface facilitates real-time interaction. It provides options to edit prompt parameters, create chains and agents, track thought processes, and export flows.

# ðŸŽ¨ Creating Flows

## Compose

Creating flows with Langflow is easy. Drag sidebar components onto the canvas and connect them together to create your pipeline. Langflow provides a range of [LangChain components](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/) to choose from, including LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains.
