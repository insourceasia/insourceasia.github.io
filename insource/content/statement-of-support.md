At InSource, we strive to deliver exceptional technical support and services to ensure a positive experience and optimal utilization of our platform for our clients. However, it is important for clients to be aware of and assume certain responsibilities during the operation and maintenance of their InSource accounts. We aim to provide clarity on these responsibilities to avoid any misunderstandings that may arise in certain situations. Here are the matters and responsibilities that clients should note when operating and maintaining their InSource accounts: 

Infrastructure and Environment Maintenance: Clients are accountable for maintaining their own infrastructure and operating environment, including hardware, networks, operating systems, and any third-party software that interacts with the InSource platform. They should also ensure the allocation of sufficient system resources for InSource. It is important to note that our customer support team cannot resolve issues caused by improper maintenance of client infrastructure and environment. 

Data Backup and Recovery: Clients must regularly backup their InSource data to prevent data loss or damage. They should monitor the success and integrity of their backups, the volume of backup data, and ensure that backup files are occupying disk space properly. Our customer support team cannot provide recovery services for data that hasn't been backed up or for incomplete backups. We also do not assume responsibility for any losses resulting from the lack of data backup. 

Product Configuration: It is the responsibility of clients to correctly configure their InSource instances. While our customer support team offers technical support and services regarding product configuration, clients are accountable for any consequences arising from improper configuration on their part. This includes not following recommended configuration changes or version upgrades as outlined in InSource's official documentation, or making modifications or customizations to the InSource source code. 

Vulnerability Fixes and Version Upgrades: InSource periodically releases new versions, which may include new features, bug fixes, and security vulnerability patches. In the case of critical vulnerabilities, clients must promptly assess whether their current version is affected and upgrade if necessary. Clients bear responsibility for any losses resulting from known vulnerabilities that have not been fixed in a timely manner. 

Staff Training and Knowledge Transfer: Clients should ensure that their team members who utilize InSource undergo proper training and knowledge transfer. Our customer support team cannot be held responsible for issues stemming from a lack of understanding of InSource products and services by client team members. 

Third-Party Integrations: Clients assume risks associated with third-party integrations. Our customer support team will assist in resolving issues related to third-party integrations within a reasonable scope. However, we are not accountable for the functionality, performance, and stability of third-party products and services. 

Compliance and Security: Clients must comply with local laws, regulations, industry standards, and internal security policies. Our customer support team cannot assume legal responsibility for any violations of these rules by clients.
